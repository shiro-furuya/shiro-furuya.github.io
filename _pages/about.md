I am Shiro Furuya, a Ph.D. candidate in sociology at [the University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://sociology.wisc.edu/) with affiliations in [the Center for Demography and Ecology](https://cde.wisc.edu/) and [the Center for Demography of Health and Aging](https://cdha.wisc.edu/). I will be on the job market in 2023-2024 academic year.

My research attempts to uncover processes that generate inequalities in a population. Guided by theories in social sciences, my works revolve around addressing causal and selective processes. Empirically, most of my works draw on the counterfactual frameworks to disentangle causality and selection. I also integrate insights from statistical genetics to address the causal and selective processes.

**Publications**

My works have been published in and are forthcoming in [*Demogrpahy*](https://read.dukeupress.edu/demography), [*PNAS*](https://www.pnas.org/), [*SSM-Population Health*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/ssm-population-health), [*SSM-Mental Health*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/ssm-mental-health), and [*Asian Population Studies*](https://www.tandfonline.com/journals/raps20).
