I am a Ph.D. candidate in Sociology at [the University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://sociology.wisc.edu/) with affiliations in [the Center for Demography and Ecology](https://cde.wisc.edu/) and [the Center for Demography of Health and Aging](https://cdha.wisc.edu/). Prior to graduate study, I was a software developer at [Fujitsu Ltd.](https://www.fujitsu.com/global/) specialized in the health indsutry.

My substantive research interests include social demography, health, aging, the life course, and families around the globe. My research uncovers processes that generate inequalities. Guided by theories in the social sciences, my works revolve around addressing causal and selective processes. Empirically, most of my work draws on the counterfactual framework to disentangle causality and selection. I also integrate insights from statistical genetics to leverage interdisciplinary synergies for social research.
