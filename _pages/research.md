## Papers Under Review
- **Furuya, Shiro**, and Jason M. Fletcher. “Retirement Makes You Old? Effect of Retirement on Biological Age.” (Invited to R&R at [*Demography*](https://read.dukeupress.edu/demography) (third round)).
  - **Abstract**: Retirement is a critical life event for older people. Health scholars have scrutinized health effects of retirement, but its consequences on age-related diseases and mortality are unclear. We extend this body of research by integrating measurements of biological age, representing the physiological decline preceding disease onset. Using data from the UK Biobank and a fuzzy regression discontinuity design, we estimated the effects of retirement on two biomarker-based biological age measures. Results showed that retirement significantly increases biological age for those who retired at the State Pension eligibility age by 0.871–2.503 years, depending on sex and specific biological age measurement. Given the emerging scientific discussion about direct interventions to biological age to achieve additional improvements in population health, the positive effect of retirement on biological age has important implications for an increase in the State Pension eligibility age and its potential consequences on population health, public health care policy, and older people’s labor force participation. Overall, this study provides novel empirical evidence contributing to the question of *what social factors make people old*.

- **Furuya, Shiro**, and James M. Raymo. “Loneliness at Older Ages in Japan: Variation in Lonely Life Expectancy and the Role of Social Isolation.” (Revised and resubmitted to [*Population Research and Policy Review*](https://link.springer.com/journal/11113) (second round)).
  - **Abstract**: Loneliness is the focus of growing media, policy, and research attention, but remains an understudied dimension of social inequality among demographers and other social scientists. This study examines the duration of exposure to loneliness at older ages in Japan, the world’s oldest country. Analyses conceptually and methodologically account for the related, but distinct, concept of social isolation. Combining life tables from the Human Mortality Database with individual data from the National Survey of Japanese Elderly, we used Sullivan’s method to calculate lonely life expectancy (LLE) and isolation-adjusted LLE by sex, region of residence, and educational attainment. LLE at age 60 was 2.4 to 2.7 years for Japanese men and 4.1 to 5.0 years among women. These sex differences became less pronounced after accounting for social isolation, especially family-related aspects of isolation. We found no clear regional or educational differences in (isolation-adjusted) LLE. In contrast to public perceptions of growing loneliness, we found that (isolation-adjusted) LLE is relatively short among older Japanese and has not increased over time.

- **Furuya, Shiro**. "Cumulative Effect of Retirement on Mortality."
  - **Abstract**: Mortality effects of retirement in prior work are rarely informative (statistically significant). However, this does not necessarily indicate the absence of mortality effect of retirement. While prior works assumed an instantaneous change in mortality risk upon retirement, the mortality effect of retirement may cumulatively evolve upon retirement. Using the Health and Retirement Study and fuzzy regression discontinuity and kink designs, I estimated mortality effects of retirement and retirement duration. Consistent with prior work, I find no evidence for a sudden jump in mortality risk at retirement. By contrast, I find that each additional year of retirement duration increases mortality risk by 0.9 percentage points, suggesting growing inequalities in mortality risk between retirees and non-retirees. The positive, cumulative mortality effect of retirement at the Social Security eligibility age has important implications for an increase in the Social Security eligibility age, population health, and welfare programs to support older people in the U.S.
